# Makerkit - Supabase SaaS Starter Kit - Turbo Edition

This is a Starter Kit for building SaaS applications using Supabase, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

This version uses Turborepo to manage multiple packages in a single repository.

**This project is stable but still under development. Please update the repository daily**.

This repository is the demo version hosted on Cloudflare Pages. Please use the vanilla kit as starter - as this is used for testing all the features.

[Please follow the documentation to get started](https://makerkit.dev/docs/next-supabase-turbo/introduction).
